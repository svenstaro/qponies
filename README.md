qponies - desktop ponies using qml
==================================

Why
===
Because the other desktop ponies implementations are slow, they flicker and they
are not using QML.

How
===
To get this, you will need a very recent version of Qt (4.7.4 and above).
Compile using the ususal procedure when dealing with Qt things:

- mkdir build
- cd build
- qmake ..
- make

A wonderful executable will form in build/
